# SQL-magic
This demonstrates sql-magic in use on three sets of datasets in an effort to query data from the datasets.

By answering assignment questions powered by Cognitive AI, I was able to query data from three datasets loaded into an IBM-Db2 database. 
Though the questions were directed, the code was from scratch and was good way to practice what I learnt

The queries included:
- Finding the total number of items in a row
- Comparing data from columns in two different tables for similarity
- Using the where clause to set conditions.
- Getting rows that started with a specific string
- Using sub-queries
- Comparing data between the three tables to retrieve rows that meet certain criteria without explicitly using a Join operator.
